From the waveform can be noticed that when the RST_n signal is low the reset is active and the output is zeroed-out. Once the reset becomes high, the ACCUMULATE signal is high, thus we accumulate A to the current state (0 + 1). On the next rising edge of the clock the ACCUMULATE signal is low, so A + B is computed and stored as new current state (0 + 2). Finally on the last rising edge of the clock ACCUMULATE signal is active, thus A is accumulated to the current state (10 + 2).
